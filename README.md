### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. My work revolves around **large language models**, **multimodal learning**, **world models**, and **reinforcement learning**. I’m passionate about building intelligent agents, exploring innovative learning strategies, and redefining what AI can do in dynamic environments—especially in games and simulations.

### 🔭 Current Project

- **🌊 World Model + VLM Pipeline for Environment Simulation** *(Master’s Dissertation)*  
  Developing a hybrid framework that combines a **vision-language model (VLM)** for high-level planning with a **learned world model** for low-level simulation.  
  🎮 **Target Task**: Atari Breakout  
  🎯 **Goal**: Bridge high-level reasoning and low-level control in interactive environments.
