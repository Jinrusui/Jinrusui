## Hi there 👋 I'm Jinru Sui

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh with a strong focus on **large language/multimodal models**, **world model**, and **reinforcement learning**. I enjoy building intelligent agents, exploring innovative learning methods, and pushing the boundaries of game AI.

### 🔭 Current Projects
- **🌊 World Model + VLM Pipeline for Environment Simulation** (Master’s Dissertation)  
  Developing a hybrid framework where a **vision-language model** plans actions and a **learned world model** simulates outcomes for fine-grained tasks.  
  🎮 **Target Task**: Atari Breakout  
  🔍 **Goal**: Bridge high-level reasoning and low-level control.

### 🧠 Interests & Strengths
- **Multimodal AI**: Vision-language alignment, multimodal reasoning, embodied agents  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reward shaping, curriculum learning, model-based RL  
- **Large Language Models**: Fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, chain-of-thought (CoT), character role-playing  
- **NLP**: POS tagging, dependency parsing, word embeddings  

### 📚 Academic & Technical Skills
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers  
- **Tools**: Blender (for rendering and AR), SpaCy, Scikit-learn  
- **Infrastructure**: Linux, Google Cloud Platform, Git
